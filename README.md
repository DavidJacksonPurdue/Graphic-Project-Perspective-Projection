# Graphic-Project-Perspective-Projection

1st real project with OpenGL. Live calculates live matrix perspective projection on a simple box city mapping. Navigation of city can be performed using WASD and the arrow keys (WASD controls movement, arrows controls orientation). The boxes have been animated to grow and shrink to demonstrate live nature of perspective.
